# BackwardsAirbrakeSimulation
Makes use of a backwards physics engine to determine which deployment level would be ideal for a rocket's airbrake.

Code currently uses finals2000A.all from https://datacenter.iers.org/products/eop/rapid/standard/ in order to get ISA Standard air density from different altitudes, however, I would like to find a better way.

Next big step is to make the physics 2-dimensional.
